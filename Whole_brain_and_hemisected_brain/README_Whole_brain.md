## Best Printing Orientation and Recommended Settings for Whole Brain Model (PLA/FDM)

### Best Printing Orientation

**Recommended Orientation:**  
- Position the brain model with the flat base (ventral side, where the cerebellum and brainstem are) on the print bed.

**Rationale:**  
- The ventral side provides more structural stability for placement.  
- This orientation minimizes the need for support material, ensuring better resolution of surface details on the dorsal (top) and lateral (side) regions.  
- Fewer support scars preserve the intricate details of the gyri and sulci.

## Recommended Print Settings

### Layer Height:
- **High Detail:** 0.1 mm to capture grooves and ridges accurately.  
- **Faster Printing:** 0.2 mm with moderate detail retention.

### Infill:
- **Percentage:** 15–20%  
- **Pattern:** Grid or gyroid to balance strength and printing time.

### Print Speed:
- 40–60 mm/s to maintain detail accuracy without compromising quality.

### Supports:
- **Type:** Use supports for overhangs; tree supports are recommended if available in your slicer.  
- **Density:** 10–15% to reduce post-processing.  
- **Placement:** Touching build plate only.

### Bed Adhesion:
- Employ a brim or raft for stabilization, considering the complex base and size of the model.

### Print Temperature:
- **PLA:** 200–210°C nozzle temperature; 50–60°C bed temperature.

### Cooling:
- Enable cooling fans to improve bridging performance and surface quality.

### Wall Thickness:
- 2–3 perimeters (approximately 0.8–1.2 mm) for durability and detail retention.

## Post-Processing

- Gently sand areas where supports were removed to smooth the surface.  
- Optionally, apply a primer and paint to achieve a realistic finish.
