### Best Printing Orientation

**Optimal Position:**  
- Position the model with the flat, detailed side facing upward.  
- This preserves the intricate features of the detailed surface and avoids contact with supports during printing.  

**Reason:**  
- Ensuring the flat, detailed side remains untouched by supports prevents damage to critical textures like gyri and sulci.  

## Recommended Print Settings

### Layer Height:
- 0.1 mm for high detail.

### Print Speed:
- **General Areas:** 40-50 mm/s  

### Infill Settings:
- **Infill Percentage:**  
  - 15-20% (gyroid or grid for strength).  

### Overhang Considerations:
- **Supports:**  
  - Enable supports for the curved underside.  
  - Use tree supports to minimize contact with detailed regions.  

### Adhesion:
- Use a brim or raft to stabilize the model during printing.  

### Material:
- PLA for ease of use and fine detail.  

### Additional Notes:
- Use adaptive layer height if your slicer supports it, to capture the fine textures on the upward-facing surface.  
- Orient the model slightly tilted (if necessary) to balance support requirements while preserving critical details.
