### Best Printing Orientation

**Upright Position:**  
- Position the model so the main arteries leading from the circle of Willis extend vertically, minimizing overhangs.  
- Slightly angle the model if needed to reduce the need for excessive supports in fragile, detailed areas.  
- Ensure the base arteries or any thicker branches form a stable anchor point to minimize warping or detachment.  

## Recommended Print Settings

### Layer Height:
- Use 0.1 mm or finer for detailed preservation of the thin, intricate vessels.

### Print Speed:
- **Detailed Sections:** 30-40 mm/s  

### Infill Settings:
- **Infill Percentage:**  
  - 10% (grid or gyroid structure) as the model is mostly walls and thin structures.  

### Overhang Considerations:
- **Supports:**  
  - Enable tree supports for organic shapes, targeting underhangs and intersections.  
  - Place supports around the thinner outermost branches to avoid sagging but keep them minimal to prevent difficulty in removal.  

### Wall Settings:
- **Wall Thickness:**  
  - 1-2 perimeter walls to ensure structural integrity without bulking the model.  

### Material:
- PLA is ideal due to its detail retention, low shrinkage, and ease of use.  

### Cooling:
- Enable maximum cooling (100%) to solidify small features effectively.  

### Adhesion:
- Use a brim or raft for bed adhesion, especially given the small contact points of some arteries.
