### Recommended Printing Orientation

**Positioning:**  
- Orient the ventral side of the brainstem downward (the smooth, wide surface from the last image).  
- Rotate the cranial nerves and vascular structures upward to prevent crushing or deformation.

**Rationale:**  
- Printing from the ventral side ensures the bulk of the model is structurally supported.  
- Complex areas like cranial nerves can be better resolved with upward-facing supports.

## General Settings

### Layer Height:
- **For high detail:** 0.1 mm

### Print Speed:
- **For intricate features and overhangs:** 40-50 mm/s

### Infill Settings:
- **Infill Percentage:**  
  - For structural integrity: 15-20%
- **Infill Pattern:**  
  - Gyroid or Grid (for consistent support and reduced weight)

### Wall Settings:
- **Wall Thickness:**  
  - Minimum: 1.2 mm (3 perimeter lines for 0.4 mm nozzle)
- **Wall Line Count:**  
  - Standard: 3-4 lines

### Overhang Considerations:
- **Support Structures:**  
  - Use tree supports for minimal contact and easy removal.  
  - Place supports under cranial nerves and overhanging vascular structures.
- **Bridging Settings:**  
  - Reduce speed during bridging (20-30 mm/s).  
  - Enable cooling fans for bridging areas.

### Additional Settings:
- **Build Plate Adhesion:**  
  - Use a brim or raft to improve adhesion.  
- **Cooling:**  
  - Enable cooling fans for intricate details.  
  - Set fan speed to 100% after the initial layers.

## Post-Processing

- Carefully remove supports with precision tools to avoid damaging cranial nerves.  
- Sand and smooth surfaces if necessary, especially for fine details.
