## Recommended Orientation for Printing

### Key Positioning Guidelines:
1. **Cross-Section Facing Sideways (Lateral Orientation):**
   - Rotate the model 90° so the **detailed top and bottom cross-sections** are aligned vertically (side-facing). This orientation preserves the intricate anatomical details by avoiding support structures on these planes.

2. **Curved Side Flat Against the Print Bed:**
   - Place the **curved side** of the midbrain model flat against the print bed. This provides a stable base for printing and reduces the need for supports along the curved surface.

3. **Slight Tilt (Optional):**
   - Apply a slight tilt (10–15°) to minimize the flat contact area with the print bed and improve adhesion. This adjustment also enhances layer transitions and cooling for better print quality.

## Recommended Print Settings

### Layer Height:
- **Fine detail layer height:** 0.1 mm  
  This ensures accurate reproduction of the midbrain’s intricate cross-sections.

### Print Speed:
- **Detailed regions:** 40–50 mm/s for precision  
- **Less intricate areas:** Up to 70 mm/s  

### Infill:
- **Infill percentage:**  
  - 15–20% to balance structural support and material usage  

### Overhang Support:
- **Support type:** Tree supports  
  - Focus on external overhangs to maintain the integrity of the cross-sections.  
  - Avoid placing supports directly on the cross-sectional planes.

### Cooling:
- Enable active fan cooling to ensure sharp layer definition and prevent warping.

## Rationale

1. **Side Orientation for Cross-Section Details:**  
   Aligning the cross-sections vertically ensures that the intricate anatomical features of the midbrain are not obscured or distorted during printing.

2. **Stability and Minimal Support Needs:**  
   Placing the curved surface against the print bed provides stability and reduces the likelihood of support marks on the detailed sections.

3. **Preservation of Detail:**  
   The recommended settings prioritize precision, layer fidelity, and minimal interference from support structures, ensuring accurate representation of the midbrain anatomy.

This orientation ensures optimal detail preservation and printing stability, ideal for creating precise and detailed anatomical models.
