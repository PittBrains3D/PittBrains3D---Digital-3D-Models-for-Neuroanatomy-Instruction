## Recommended Orientation for Printing

### Key Positioning Guidelines:
1. **Cross-Section Facing Sideways (Lateral Orientation):**
   - Rotate the model 90° so the **detailed top and bottom cross-sections** are aligned vertically (side-facing). This ensures that these intricate details are preserved and avoid distortion during printing.
   - This orientation reduces the risk of support structures interfering with the cross-sectional details.

2. **Flat Surface Against Print Bed:**
   - Place the **curved side** of the model flat against the print bed. This provides stability during printing and minimizes the need for extensive supports on the curved surface.

3. **Slight Tilt (Optional):**
   - Apply a slight tilt (10–15°) to reduce flat contact with the print bed and improve layer adhesion. This adjustment also facilitates better cooling and print quality.

## Recommended Print Settings

### Layer Height:
- **Fine detail layer height:** 0.1 mm  
  This setting ensures accurate reproduction of the cross-sectional details.

### Print Speed:
- **Detailed regions:** 40–50 mm/s for precision  
- **Less intricate areas:** Up to 70 mm/s  

### Infill:
- **Infill percentage:**  
  - 15–20% to balance structural support and material usage  

### Overhang Support:
- **Support type:** Tree supports  
  - Focus on external overhangs to maintain the integrity of the cross-sections.  
  - Avoid placing supports directly on the cross-sectional planes.

### Cooling:
- Enable active fan cooling to ensure sharp layer definition and prevent warping.

## Rationale

1. **Side Orientation for Cross-Section Details:**  
   Aligning the cross-sections vertically (side-facing) ensures that the fine anatomical features of the caudal medulla are not obscured or flattened by the printing process.

2. **Stability and Minimal Support Needs:**  
   Placing the curved surface against the print bed provides stability, while tilting slightly reduces overhang challenges.

3. **Preservation of Detail:**  
   The recommended settings prioritize precision and layer fidelity, ensuring the brainstem's intricate cross-sections are captured accurately.

This orientation maximizes detail preservation and minimizes support interference, ideal for accurate and detailed 3D printing of anatomical models.
